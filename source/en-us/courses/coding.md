VEX VRC Robot Training Class is a robot competition project specially designed for middle school and high school students.

In this competition, we focus on cultivating teamwork, innovative thinking and problem-solving skills, providing students with a platform to practice applied science and engineering principles.

VEX is recognized by major prestigious schools. It can not only improve children's logic ability, teamwork skills, engineering basics and programming skills, but also help them stand out in high school and college applications.
